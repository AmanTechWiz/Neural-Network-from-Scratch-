# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks

## Overview

This project implements a **Neural Network** from scratch to recognize handwritten digits. The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset** and is capable of predicting digits based on user input. The entire process, including the model architecture, training, and saving the model, is done without relying on any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The model is built using only NumPy for matrix operations and data manipulation.

** Kindly download MNIST handwritten digits (0-9) dataset with training and testing csv files.

## Features

- **Neural Network Model**: Custom-built neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
- **Backend Only**: Model implementation with NumPy without using high-level deep learning frameworks.
- **Training on MNIST**: The network is trained on the MNIST dataset, one of the most well-known datasets for handwritten digit recognition.
- **Model Weights**: The trained modelâ€™s weights are saved to a `.npy` file for later use and predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the implementation.
- **NumPy**: For matrix operations, forward propagation, and backpropagation.
- **MNIST Dataset**: Standard dataset for training handwritten digit classifiers.
